# TypeScript Node.js Express Boilerplate

This boilerplate provides a foundation for building TypeScript-based Node.js applications using the Express framework and following the MVCS (Model, View, Controller, Service) architecture.

## Features

- TypeScript for type-safe development
- Express for handling HTTP requests
- MVCS architecture for organized codebase
- Jest and Supertest for testing
- ESLint and Prettier for code linting and formatting

## Requirements

- Node.js >= 12.x
- npm or yarn

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-project.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd your-project
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:

   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add necessary environment variables.

4. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to see the application running.

## Project Structure

The project follows the MVCS architecture:

- `src/`
  - `controllers/`: Controllers for handling HTTP requests.
  - `models/`: Data models and database schema.
  - `services/`: Business logic and services.
  - `views/`: Frontend views (if applicable).
  - `routes.ts`: Express routes configuration.
  - `app.ts`: Main Express application setup.
- `test/`: Contains unit and integration tests.
- `config/`: Configuration files.
- `scripts/`: Helper scripts for development tasks.
- `dist/`: Compiled TypeScript files (generated during build).

## Scripts

- `npm run dev`: Start the development server with automatic reloading using nodemon.
- `npm run build`: Compile TypeScript files to JavaScript.
- `npm start`: Start the production server (requires build step).
- `npm test`: Run tests using Jest.
- `npm run lint`: Lint TypeScript files using ESLint.
- `npm run format`: Format code using Prettier.

## Testing

Run tests using:

```bash
npm test
```

Tests are located in the `test/` directory and are written using Jest and Supertest.
